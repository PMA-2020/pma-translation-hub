# ISSUE 1 - Users unable to register/login.
# I have temporarily taken related dependencies from the list above and put them below to try differentp combinations.
# End of log:
# Oct 18 13:10:47 pma-translation-hub-staging app/web.1:    File "/app/.heroku/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/bcrypt/__init__.py", line 50, in gensalt
# Oct 18 13:10:47 pma-translation-hub-staging app/web.1:      output = _bcrypt.ffi.new("unsigned char[]", 30)
# Oct 18 13:10:47 pma-translation-hub-staging app/web.1:  AttributeError: module 'bcrypt._bcrypt' has no attribute 'ffi'
# Oct 18 13:13:26 pma-translation-hub-staging heroku/run.9841:  State changed from up to complete

# Suggested solutions:
# * pip uninstall py-bcrypt http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980976/python-bcrypt-package-on-heroku-gives-attributeerror-module-object-has-no-att
# * try different dependency combinations
#   * install other dependencies
#   * remove redundant dependencies
# * Re-do what I've done in just-a-dash.

# Attempt 1 - FAILED
# This was the application default.
# Flask-Bcrypt==0.7.1
# bcrypt==3.1.0
# cffi==1.7.0

# Attempt 2 - FAILED
# Notes: Tried this because cryptography or cffi appeared to be maybe dependency of 'bcrypt', if not 'Flask-Bcrypt'.
# Did not solve the issue.
# Flask-Bcrypt==0.7.1
# bcrypt==3.1.0
# cffi==1.7.0
# cryptography

# Attempt 3 - Trying same thing as 'Attempt 1', but with some changes to models.py.
